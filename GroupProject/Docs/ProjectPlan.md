## 1 Introduction


JobCompare, your job offer companion. Help with your post-graduation decision-making process by ranking and comparing job offers, considering multiple factors and making well-informed career decisions right from your Android device.


## 2 Process Description


### Define Purpose and Scope
Outline the purpose of the JobCompare app: to assist users in making informed career decisions by comparing job offers.\
Entrance Criteria is to identify key features such as Salary Comparison.\
Exit Criteria is initializing the Use Case Model and developing a tentative architecture.
### Design Software System
Create design documents for the JobCompare app to utilize when implementing features.\
Entrance Criteria is application requirements being determined.\
Exit Criteria is UML diagrams to feed other processes.
### Design UI and Implement Functionality
Create UI design for the app. Integrate functionality from the back end into the design so the app works correctly. Ensure the app fits well on android devices and no data is improperly displayed. Implement data limits on user inputs to ensure functionality is retained.\
Entrance Criteria is System Design documents being finalized and Back End development functions being defined.\
Exit Criteria is an app with buttons that allow the user to call different functions, boxes to input data to those functions, and displaying returns from those functions.
### Back End Implementation
All features are developed. The emphasis will shift from intellectual property development to product development.\
Entrance Criteria is that System Design documents being finalized and Back End development functions being defined.\
Exit Criteria is that the interfaces and classes are ready for testing.
### Unit Testing
Write unit tests for all application code and meet code coverage requirements. This ensures application behavior is consistent with the requirements, and also prevents breaks due to future code changes.\
Entrance Criteria: Application requirement, class diagram, and interfaces for each class need to be defined.\
Exit Criteria: Code coverage of major functionality and logic branches. 
### Integration and Regression Testing
Create an integration test suite that tests integration between the components of the system. The defined contract between various components such as UI, backend and database will stay consistent between each release cycle.\
Entrance Criteria: Interface/contract needs to be defined between each component outlined in the component diagram.\
Exit Criteria: Test cases that cover major behavior of the components by virtue of their integration with other components.

## 3 Team
### Team Members

### Roles
Front End: The front-end developer focuses on the user interface(UI) design and implementing functionality into the UI. Force data limits on user input values and throw proper errors when necessary.
Back End: The back-end developer will manage the business logic, and ensure the communication between the app's front end and the database. 
Database: The database administrator will design and maintain the database that stores information for the app. The database administrator will also manage data storage and create tables to store data.
Testing: The testing lead will be in charge of managing testing expectation and monitoring the progress of the unit/system/regression test suites.
